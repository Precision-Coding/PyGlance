# PyGlance  
Hello and welcome to PyGlace a 3D rendering library with perspective projection available for python  
In this project we plan to create a functional library allowing programtic interactions with 3D objects such as translations, rotations, resizing, texturing/colouring and basic lighting and shadows  

# Installing Dependencies  
This step is largely automatic runnning Main.py should install all neccasary components and if not some manual intervention may have to be done on the part of the developer
